## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Encryption**: Use strong encryption for sensitive data
- **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive information

#### Development Security
```cpp
// Good: Parameterized query
PreparedStatement* stmt = CharacterDatabase.GetPreparedStatement(CHAR_SEL_CHARACTER_BY_GUID);
stmt->setUInt32(0, guid);
QueryResult result = CharacterDatabase.Query(stmt);

// Bad: String concatenation (SQL injection risk)
std::string query = "SELECT * FROM characters WHERE guid = " + std::to_string(guid);
QueryResult result = CharacterDatabase.Query(query.c_str());
```

#### Configuration Security
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit passwords or API keys
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- **Access Control**: Implement least privilege access principles
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and libraries updated

### For Server Administrators

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Firewall Configuration**: Properly configure UFW/iptables
- **SSH Hardening**: Use key-based authentication only
- **SSL/TLS**: Implement strong encryption for web services
- **Database Security**: Secure MySQL with proper user permissions
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

#### Operational Security
- **Regular Backups**: Maintain secure, tested backups
- **Update Management**: Apply security updates promptly
- **Access Auditing**: Regularly review user access and permissions
- **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents
